# Profile Report Script
Script that can use either an Advanced Search or the Profiles endpoint to create a report. 

## To-Do
- Create caching of profile records to avoid potential errors of memory usage
- Pass in limit, offset, tenat, token, etc as arguments from on command line
- Use a /profiles_types look up for the Profile Type ID, so you can just select from a list
